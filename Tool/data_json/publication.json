    "abstract_en": "The active flux (AF) method is a compact high-order finite volume method that evolves cell averages and point values at cell interfaces independently. Within the method of lines framework, the point value can be updated based on Jacobian splitting (JS), incorporating the upwind idea. However, such JS-based AF methods encounter transonic issues for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate upwind direction estimation. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to the transonic issue. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for one-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average in high-order AF methods is rewritten as a convex combination of using the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. Several challenging benchmark tests are conducted to verify the accuracy, BP properties, and shock-capturing ability of the methods.",

The extra toroidal transformation from the physical domain to the computational domain has to be taken into consideration. In the computational domain, the fourth-order finite difference scheme is constructed on a Cartesian computational mesh. To verify the code, we simulate the internal kink mode in a W7-X configuration, and benchmark the linear and non-linear results with the M3D-C code.

To obtain an energy inequality, the convexity of an energy function for an arbitrary $M$ is proved by finding recurrence relations of the leading principal minors or the quadratic forms of the Hessian matrix of the energy function with respect to the conservative variables, which is more involved than the single-layer case due to the coupling between the layers in the energy function. An important ingredient in developing high-order semi-discrete ES schemes is the construction of a two-point energy conservative (EC) numerical flux. In pursuit of the WB property, a sufficient condition for such EC fluxes is given with compatible discretizations of the source terms similar to the single-layer case. It can be decoupled into $M$ identities individually for each layer, making it convenient to construct a two-point EC flux for the multi-layer system. To suppress possible oscillations near discontinuities, WENO-based dissipation terms are added to the high-order WB EC fluxes, which gives semi-discrete high-order WB ES schemes. Fully-discrete schemes are obtained by employing high-order explicit SSP-RK methods and proved to preserve the lake at rest. The schemes are further extended to moving meshes based on a modified energy function for a reformulated system, relying on the techniques proposed in [51]. Numerical experiments are conducted for some two- and three-layer cases to validate the high-order accuracy, WB and ES properties, and high efficiency of the schemes, with a suitable amount of dissipation chosen by estimating the maximal wave speed due to the lack of an analytical expression for the eigenstructure of the multi-layer system.",

This paper presents a data-driven aerodynamic force prediction model based on a small number of pressure sensors located on the surface of a UAV. The model is built on a linear term that can make a reasonably accurate prediction and a nonlinear correction for accuracy improvement. The linear term is based on a reduced basis reconstruction of surface pressure, with the basis extracted from simulation data and the basis coefficients determined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of optimal sensor locations, which are obtained by using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The nonlinear term is an artificial neural network that is trained to bridge the gap between the DEIM prediction and the ground truth, especially when only low-fidelity simulation data are available. The model is tested on numerical and experimental dynamic stall data of a two-dimensional NACA0015 airfoil and numerical simulation data of the dynamic stall of a three-dimensional drone. Numerical results demonstrate that the machine-learning-enhanced model is accurate, efficient, and robust, even for the NACA0015 case, in which the simulations do not agree well with the wind tunnel experiments.",

    "abstract_en": "Reduced-order models are indispensable for multi-query or real-time problems. However, there are still many challenges to constructing efficient ROMs for time-dependent parametrized problems. Using a linear reduced space is inefficient for time-dependent nonlinear problems, especially for transport-dominated problems. The non-linearity usually needs to be addressed by hyper-reduction techniques, such as DEIM, but it is intrusive and relies on the assumption of affine dependence of parameters. This paper proposes and studies a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approach for time-dependent parametrized problems. It is purely data-driven and naturally split into offline and online stages. During the offline stage, a convolutional autoencoder, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is trained to perform dimensionality reduction. The encoder compresses the full-order solution snapshots to a nonlinear manifold or a low-dimensional reduced/latent space. The decoder allows the recovery of the full-order solution from the latent space. To deal with the time-dependent problems, a high-order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) is utilized to model the trajectories in the latent space for each parameter. During the online stage, the HODMD models are first utilized to obtain the latent variables at a new time, then interpolation techniques are adopted to recover the latent variables at a new parameter value, and the full-order solution is recovered by the decoder. Some numerical tests are conducted to show that the approach can be used to predict the unseen full-order solution at new times and parameter values fast and accurately, including transport-dominated problems.",

In such predictor step, a local Cauchy problem in each cell is solved based on a weak formulation of the original equations in spacetime. The resulting spacetime representation of the numerical solution provides the temporal accuracy that matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying DG solution.

    "abstract_en": "This paper proposes a second-order accurate scheme for solving the two-dimensional kinetic Vicsek swarming model. The second-order Strang operator splitting technique is used to decouple the convection terms and collision terms, and the high-resolution MUSCL scheme is used to discretize the convection terms. The spectral method and the second-order implicit Runge-Kutta method are used in the velocity and time directions, respectively, for the approximation of the subproblem in the collision part. Several one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments are given to test the accuracy and effectiveness of the scheme. Numerical results It shows that the proposed scheme achieves second-order accuracy, and can resolve discontinuities in the solution to the Riemann problems better compared with the first-order scheme in [J Comput Phys, 2015, 297: 32-46].",

The systems also preserve mass conservation, and numerical experiments show that this approach captures the key features of the model such as shock waves, contact discontinuities, rarefaction waves, vortex formations. If the system order increases, the solutions of the moment systems converge to the solution of the corresponding kinetic equation.",
