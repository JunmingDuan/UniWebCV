Within the method of lines framework, the existing Jacobian splitting-based point value update incorporates the upwind idea but suffers from a stagnation issue for nonlinear problems due to inaccurate estimation of the upwind direction, and also from a mesh alignment issue partially resulting from decoupled point value updates. This paper proposes to use flux vector splitting for the point value update, offering a natural and uniform remedy to those two issues. To improve robustness, this paper also develops bound-preserving (BP) AF methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. Two cases are considered: preservation of the maximum principle for the scalar case, and preservation of positive density and pressure for the compressible Euler equations. The update of the cell average is rewritten as a convex combination of the original high-order fluxes and robust low-order (local Lax-Friedrichs or Rusanov) fluxes, and the desired bounds are enforced by choosing the right amount of low-order fluxes. A similar blending strategy is used for the point value update. In addition, a shock sensor-based limiting is proposed to enhance the convex limiting for the cell average, which can suppress oscillations well. Several challenging tests are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the BP AF methods, including flow past a forward-facing step and high Mach number jets.')">[<a class=".text-primary">abstract</a>] </button> <div id='abstract2'></div></li>

To obtain an energy inequality, the convexity of an energy function for an arbitrary $M$ is proved by finding recurrence relations of the leading principal minors or the quadratic forms of the Hessian matrix of the energy function with respect to the conservative variables, which is more involved than the single-layer case due to the coupling between the layers in the energy function. An important ingredient in developing high-order semi-discrete ES schemes is the construction of a two-point energy conservative (EC) numerical flux. In pursuit of the WB property, a sufficient condition for such EC fluxes is given with compatible discretizations of the source terms similar to the single-layer case. It can be decoupled into $M$ identities individually for each layer, making it convenient to construct a two-point EC flux for the multi-layer system. To suppress possible oscillations near discontinuities, WENO-based dissipation terms are added to the high-order WB EC fluxes, which gives semi-discrete high-order WB ES schemes. Fully-discrete schemes are obtained by employing high-order explicit SSP-RK methods and proved to preserve the lake at rest. The schemes are further extended to moving meshes based on a modified energy function for a reformulated system, relying on the techniques proposed in [51]. Numerical experiments are conducted for some two- and three-layer cases to validate the high-order accuracy, WB and ES properties, and high efficiency of the schemes, with a suitable amount of dissipation chosen by estimating the maximal wave speed due to the lack of an analytical expression for the eigenstructure of the multi-layer system.')">[<a class=".text-primary">abstract</a>] </button> <div id='abstract3'></div></li>

The linear term is based on a reduced basis reconstruction of surface pressure, with the basis extracted from simulation data and the basis coefficients determined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of optimal sensor locations, which are obtained by using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM).

However, there are still many challenges to constructing efficient ROMs for time-dependent parametrized problems. Using a linear reduced space is inefficient for time-dependent nonlinear problems, especially for transport-dominated problems. The non-linearity usually needs to be addressed by hyper-reduction techniques, such as DEIM, but it is intrusive and relies on the assumption of affine dependence of parameters. This paper proposes and studies a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approach for time-dependent parametrized problems. It is purely data-driven and naturally split into offline and online stages. During the offline stage, a convolutional autoencoder, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is trained to perform dimensionality reduction. The encoder compresses the full-order solution snapshots to a nonlinear manifold or a low-dimensional reduced/latent space. The decoder allows the recovery of the full-order solution from the latent space. To deal with the time-dependent problems, a high-order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) is utilized to model the trajectories in the latent space for each parameter. During the online stage, the HODMD models are first utilized to obtain the latent variables at a new time, then interpolation techniques are adopted to recover the latent variables at a new parameter value, and the full-order solution is recovered by the decoder. Some numerical tests are conducted to show that the approach can be used to predict the unseen full-order solution at new times and parameter values fast and accurately, including transport-dominated problems.')">[<a class=".text-primary">abstract</a>] </button> <div id='abstract5'></div></li>

The scheme is constructed on a uniform Cartesian computational mesh that is obtained from a non-uniform adaptive moving mesh in the physical domain through the coordinate transformation. Mesh points in the physical domain in general move and concentrate in the vicinity of solutions with rapid variations by solving an adaptive mesh equation, whilst total number of mesh points remains unchanged.

Unlike multi-stage Runge-Kutta methods used in the Runge-Kutta DG (RKDG) schemes, the ADER scheme is one-stage in time discretization, which is desirable in many applications. The ADER scheme used here relies on a local continuous spacetime Galerkin predictor instead of the usual Cauchy-Kovalewski procedure to achieve high order accuracy both in space and time. In such predictor step, a local Cauchy problem in each cell is solved based on a weak formulation of the original equations in spacetime. The resulting spacetime representation of the numerical solution provides the temporal accuracy that matches the spatial accuracy of the underlying DG solution. The scheme is formulated in the modal space and the volume integral and the numerical fluxes at the cell interfaces can be explicitly written. The explicit formulae of the scheme at third order is provided on two-dimensional structured meshes. The computational complexity of the ADER-DG scheme is compared to that of the RKDG scheme. Numerical experiments are also provided to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our scheme.')">[<a class=".text-primary">abstract</a>] </button> <div id='abstract15'></div></li>

First, the PCP property (i.e. preserving the positivity of the rest-mass density and the pressure and the bound of the velocity) is proved for the first-order accurate Lagrangian scheme with the HLLC Riemann solver and forward Euler time discretization. The key is that the intermediate states in the HLLC Riemann solver are shown to be admissible or PCP when the HLLC wave speeds are estimated suitably. Then, the higher-order accurate schemes are proposed by using the high-order accurate strong stability preserving (SSP) time discretizations and the scaling PCP limiter as well as the WENO reconstruction. Finally, several one- and two-dimensional numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and the effectiveness of the PCP Lagrangian schemes in solving the special RHD problems involving strong discontinuities, or large Lorentz factor, or low rest-mass density or low pressure, etc.')">[<a class=".text-primary">abstract</a>] </button> <div id='abstract16'></div></li>
